He talks about the emerging Plasma Universe Paradigm. He says that space is not empty. I tell him what I read in Astronomy magazine about Jupiter-sized worlds, twice as many as stars, lonely worlds wandering unanchored to a sun, or primary star. Recently, I have been fantasizing of an elegant teahouse in orbit around such a giant world surrounded by sunless darkness. I call this quiet, eerie fantasy \"La Teejo\" in Esperanto, or undecidedly \"la .tcat. .barj.\" in Lojban. Some men prefer a Bath and Sauna Dream.",
