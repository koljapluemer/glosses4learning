  "content": "The recent outbreak of monkeypox in the American mid-west, and its connection to prairie dogs that were kept as pets, has focused attention on so-called \"exotic pet ownership.\" Here in America, it's not at all unusual for people to keep domesticated animals like dogs, or cats, or horses as pets.
