  "content": "I knew Bratislav, of Croatian descent, personally since 2012, but I had seen him walking his two small dogs in the Lulu Island neighbourhood park in previous years without talking to him. Bratislav was unique in my opinion, as he had a really different reality view than everyone else, it seemed. He recounted stories of farm cows, whose bodies were sapped of blood by UFO aliens and engraved with circles. Ghost-like aliens could phase out of this material world, as they could pass through walls, he said. He said that there were secret space missions about which the public did not know. He was like no other person that I had met.",
