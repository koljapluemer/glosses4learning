  "content": "When I peruse my Social Media, I feel joy looking at the quaint cafés and diners in Japan, the \"refresquerías\" and \"taquerías\" in Mexico, and the rustic buffets and homey shopping malls in the Philippines. These things are interesting human activities. But I am thinking of the future. Will machines take over this world? Will the future be something to which people today cannot relate? Will humans become like cats and dogs next to intelligent machinery? After all, today, we humans coexist with cats and dogs. If there will be entities smarter than us humans, how will they relate to us humans? Will our primitive ways coexist with their superfast and higher-level thinking?",
