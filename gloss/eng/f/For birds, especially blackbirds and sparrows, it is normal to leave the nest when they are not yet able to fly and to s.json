  "content": "For birds, especially blackbirds and sparrows, it is normal to leave the nest when they are not yet able to fly and to spend a few days walking about. And it is at this stage that many of them end up being picked up and taken home by humans with good intentions but so ignorant of what is really best for these birds. And once taken home, it opens the dramatic chapter of \"what do I feed it?\" and \"how do I teach it to fly?\"",
