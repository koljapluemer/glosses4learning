  "content": "A nice lady took me into a huge, gigantic – at least from a 3-year-old's perspective – room, with tall shelves filled with toys. And I was sitting there, in one place, for I have no idea how long, but probably for a colossal 5 minutes or so, and then I just started crying like I've never cried before (or at least that's how my mom described it to me). Ladies from the kindergarten tried to calm me, but there was no use. Fortunately, my mother was still there, talking with a parent of another kid, so she came to me and took me home. And they decided to never take me there again until I was 6 or so.",
